<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>What inspired me to writing this book was a post that I made into <a href="http://Dev.to">Dev.to</a> titled “40 Python project ideas” where I mentioned a couple of projects that I did while learning and I received so lot of positive feedback plus the article made it to the top of Python Trends for that week. I then realized there is really a need for having good resources where people can learn Python by building projects and the same week I started writing the scratch of this book first pages including this one, I hope you will enjoy the Journey and Develop your Expertise with Python programmming</p>
