<p>Are you bored or learning a programming language by memorizing the syntax and keywords so you wanna embrace it by building out real life projects that you can even put out there to your resume, then this book is for you it consists of 100 Python projects that you’re going to build as you learn Python.</p>
<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>What inspired me to writing this book was a post that I made into <a href="http://Dev.to">Dev.to</a> titled “40 Python project ideas” where I mentioned a couple of projects that I did while learning and I received so lot of positive feedback plus the article made it to the top of Python Trends for that week. I then realized there is really a need for having good resources where people can learn Python by building projects and the same week I started writing the scratch of this book first pages including this one, I hope you will enjoy the Journey and Develop your Expertise with Python programmming</p>
<p>This book is dedicated for those who are eager to  learn python in handzone and  project oriented way by building real life projects, the more projects you’re going to build the more experience you’re going to give yourself with writing python code.</p>
